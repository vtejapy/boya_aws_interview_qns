# Ansible Senior Interview Guide - 6+ Years Experience

## Advanced Architecture & Design Questions

### Q1: You need to manage 50,000 servers across multiple clouds with Ansible. How would you architect this?

**Answer:**
- **Distributed Control Nodes**: Multiple Ansible controllers in different regions, each managing local infrastructure
- **Inventory Segmentation**: Split inventory by region, environment, and service tier
- **Execution Strategies**: Use `free` strategy with optimized `forks` (100-200), enable pipelining and ControlMaster
- **Resource Management**: Implement inventory caching, limit concurrent executions per controller
- **Monitoring**: Track playbook execution metrics, controller resource usage, and task performance

**Follow-up Scenario:** "One of your controllers crashes during a critical deployment to 10,000 servers. What's your approach?"

**Solution:**
- External state management to track progress
- Idempotent playbooks that can safely resume 
- Use `--limit` to target remaining hosts from backup controller
- Implement health checks before continuing deployment

### Q2: Your company runs microservices across AWS, Azure, and GCP. How do you handle secrets management for this multi-cloud setup?

**Answer:**
**Layered Approach:**
- **Level 1**: Cloud-native secret stores (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager)
- **Level 2**: HashiCorp Vault as centralized secret management
- **Level 3**: Ansible Vault for configuration secrets
- **Level 4**: Short-lived credentials with automatic rotation

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Custom lookup plugins for each cloud provider
- Secrets rotation automation with zero-downtime

- **Fact gathering**: Use `gather_subset` or disable when not needed
- **Task batching**: Replace loops with module-native batch operations
- **Parallelization**: Use `serial` and `async` strategically
- **Inventory optimization**: Implement caching for dynamic inventory

**Scenario:** "Your playbook has 1000 package installations across 200 servers taking 2 hours."

**Solution:**
- Replace individual package tasks with batch installation
- Use package manager's native batch capabilities

**Problem:** "During deployment, 30% of your hosts become unreachable due to network issues."

**Solution:**
- Continue deployment on healthy hosts
- Queue failed hosts for retry with exponential backoff
- Implement health check before critical operations
- Manual validation and targeted re-deployment for failed hosts
