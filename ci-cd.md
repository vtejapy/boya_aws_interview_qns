## 🔥 GitHub Actions - Core Concepts

### **Q1: Explain the GitHub Actions architecture and how you'd design workflows for a team of 50 developers**

**📋 Core Architecture:**
GitHub Actions operates on an **event-driven model** with these key components:
- **Events** trigger workflows (push, PR, schedule, external webhooks)
- **Workflows** contain jobs that run in parallel or sequence
- **Jobs** run on runners and contain steps
- **Actions** are reusable components from marketplace or custom-built

**👥 Team Strategy:**
For 50 developers, I'd implement:
- **Workflow Templates** in `.github/workflow-templates/` for consistency
- **Branch Protection Rules** requiring PR reviews and status checks
- **Environment Protection** with approval requirements for production
- **Reusable Workflows** for common patterns (build, test, deploy)
- **Matrix Strategies** for multi-environment testing

**🎯 Key Considerations:**
- Concurrent job limits (20 for free, more for paid plans)
- Runner minute consumption across the organization
- Secret management at repository vs organization level
- Dependency management between workflows

---

### **Q2: Compare GitHub-hosted vs Self-hosted runners - when would you choose each?**

**📊 Decision Matrix:**

| Scenario | GitHub-Hosted | Self-Hosted | Reasoning |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Open Source Project** | ✅ Preferred | ❌ Overkill | Free minutes, no maintenance |
| **Enterprise with Compliance** | ❌ Limited | ✅ Required | Data residency, custom security |
| **Heavy Docker Builds** | ❌ Slow | ✅ Optimized | Custom caching, more resources |
| **Mobile App Development** | ⚠️ Limited OS | ✅ Custom Setup | Specific Xcode versions, simulators |
| **Cost-Conscious Startup** | ✅ Pay-per-use | ❌ Fixed costs | No infrastructure overhead |

**🔧 Self-Hosted Implementation Strategy:**
- **Auto-scaling** with Kubernetes or cloud auto-scaling groups
- **Security hardening** with ephemeral runners for each job
- **Resource pools** based on job requirements (CPU-intensive, GPU, etc.)
- **Geographic distribution** for global teams

---

### **Q3: How do you handle secrets and environment variables securely across multiple environments?**

**🔒 Security Strategy:**

**Hierarchical Secret Management:**
1. **Organization Secrets** - Shared across repositories (CI tools, monitoring)
2. **Repository Secrets** - Project-specific (database URLs, API keys)
3. **Environment Secrets** - Environment-specific (prod vs staging credentials)

**Best Practices:**
- **Principle of Least Privilege** - Only necessary secrets per environment
- **Secret Rotation** - Automated rotation with external tools (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- **Audit Logging** - Track secret usage and access patterns
- **Environment Variables** for non-sensitive configuration
- **OIDC Integration** for cloud services (avoid long-lived credentials)

**🎯 Real-World Implementation:**
- Use **GitHub Environments** with protection rules
- Implement **approval workflows** for production deployments
- **Mask sensitive outputs** in logs automatically
- Regular **access reviews** and secret cleanup
